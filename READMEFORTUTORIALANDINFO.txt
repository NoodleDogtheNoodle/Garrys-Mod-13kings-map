HELLO USER

HOW DO I PLAY THE MAP?

FIRST, GO TO GMOD ON STEAM. THEN, RIGHT CLICK ON THE SMALL TAB AND BROWSE LOCAL FILES. THEN, GO TO THE FILE YOU DOWNLOADED AND GO TO THE GARRYS MOD FOLDER, THEN GO TO MAPS, NOW PUT THE
FILE IN THE FOLDER AND RUN GMOD. (DISCLAIMER: DO NOT PUT THE "README" TEXT INTO THE MAPS FOLDER, ONLY THE MAP)

Your version: beta4


CHECK THE GITHUB OFTEN TO SEE IF THERE IS AN UPDATE.
